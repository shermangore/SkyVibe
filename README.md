Listen to what the weather feels like

<h2>Objective</h2>

Web app that generates music for you based on the weather/location. Our web app will have a search function for users to look up cities, and then play music to fit the weather in that city. We’ll be using the Spotify API to search playlists and the openWeather API to look up the weather in that city. Our stack includes: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Firebase, Git, AJAX.

<h2>Design</h2>
The app will have a gif/video in the background that will change dynamically depending on the weather. There will be an icon in the top right that users can click that will trigger a modal where they can search locations. After saving the change, users can close the modal. The music player will be on the bottom of the screen. We’ll feature the city name and weather on the top. We’ll store the background images in either S3 or a separate Github repository.
